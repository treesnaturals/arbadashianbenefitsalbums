I own a brand.
I ordered water through generalizations of gaining allies through created new business concepts revolving around our original concept "Trees Naturals"
Will you be our allie? Hear us out...

So There are benfits to everything.
I found many benefits that were missing in my life of marijuana.
I realized something I created corresponded with these benefits.

Now I want to create benefits that me and my friends and family and selves can bet on, for the reality of Binches, Cigarettes, Canteens, Cans, Wrappers, Driplets, Soap, and Paper
I have published all of the benefits that I will label as my album titles, with focuses insinuated as each of my titles to the tracks on the album, what perpetuates scientific discovery.
I was able to initiate through my own creative direction, these benefits are published on my blog and are likely to be real.
I find that I have a great idea of what was the plants motion, biological mechanics, and what is part of the metaphysics of the piece of reality that I am working with.

I will create all of the albums in the backwards sub-carpathean style that I was successful in creating in 2015, To Beyond The Time That Lay Before Us.
I will use my harb, keyboard, and el salvadorean play drum to create the "43rd Page" which is the last part that I am doing first.
I will get new instruments as I make it through my ginormous list to make into individual albums.

This repository has all scientific decisions made so far and I will write more about my findings as I reach out more.
Next month, March 2024, I will by 100 sheets of paper to write letters to French persons about my songs, so 100 letters.
I will write 500 letters by the end of 2024, to inquire if they had interest in my project and even better to join us in writing "album covers" or scientific benfits of biological mechanics and metaphysics and get a good betting circle on.
It is fun to have money from making music, which is what I look forward to, but I think it would be more fun to have more people getting in on decisions for what could make them more money and improve charisma and stamina to prospect and purpose.
I really think I could even send this blurb, and would get some sort of crowd that would be inspired to join in on getting more educated and more significant in the fields of being alive.

One more technique I use, what is the inside of my body doing while I make music? Well I used a nice banking system where anything and everything I learn can be imputed to any of these categories:
Inside, labeling directly the direction of what the event is, either inside or outside, dreaming versus being in Thyroid or metaphysics communications
Reality, what is natural to what I am hearing or experiences, and identifying how many different realities there are, to be quixotic towards someone you love or are close friends to
Shatter- it is said you shatter inside your body over 1500 times per day and this is know by other cultures to be repaired or forgotten until need of repaair
Cob- getting it on with that good grow, something always being acceptable as a good corn growing for you to just relax and get away with
Selemer- givig life like properies to inannimate objects
Fun- going as the definition of acronyms and finding what makes you relax in words
Barn- nothing like getting your spiritual side of meaning gender towards what you keep or publish to your barn/barns
Party- what dinner has in store for you, thoughts of being far, not practiced yet, close, getting better at practicing, and wide, having sigificant amount of information memorized to be more intellectual.

So, now you have heard of us and hopefully gained a little amount of interest,
Check out our blog at treesnaturals.blogger.com
And our Link Tree at www.linktr.ee/treesnaturals
and our Bandcamp at arbadashian.bandcamp.com

We have so many findings so far, and the more created the closer we will get to a great reveal of our Second Phase, really living aware and sentimental, getting used to be Moms and Dads and significat others.
But don't fret, you can just add us on Instagram at Trees.Naturals, every add counts to us.
Expanding our family and feeling more in our skin through love and money and enjoyment, of what we have done, and what others have done.
We would love to rejoice with you today!
